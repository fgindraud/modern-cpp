# Session 2


## Langage

### Range-based `for`

C++11 introduced a new syntax to go through the elements of a data structure using a for loop.
This new syntax is a lot shorter, especially combined with the use of auto.

Example file [for_range.cpp](for_range.cpp) (basic example), [for_range_custom.cpp](for_range_custom.cpp)


### Ì€override` / `final`
Keywords used to ensure that a method correctly overwrites a virtual method of a parent class.

Example file: [override_final.cpp](override_final.cpp)


### `default` / `delete`
Keywords used to ensure a specific member function is present in its default version (with `default`) or forbidden (with `delete`).
This is particularly useful when dealing with multiple constructors.


### `using` syntax for typedef
An improved syntax is available for typedef statements: [typedef.cpp](typedef.cpp).


### `noexcept`
`throw(...)` specifications have been replaced by `noexcept`: [noexcept.cpp](noexcept.cpp).


## Standard library

### Sampling from distributions

### Regexp

### emplace
